    "In programming, we usually have to prompt the user to enter exactly one of our expected options. However, our program always supports only a subset of the combinations that can be input via keyboard, leading to the fact that it is hard to get users to enter the right thing on first go. In this challenge, we will force our user to re-enter **until** the user input matches one of our supported actions which are `Y` and `N` (case insensitive). The input and output of this challenge looks like the following:\n",

    "<<< Yes\n",

    "<<< y\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, in a **shopping cart**, you mostly never have less than two items. Or when you have to keep track of what to do within your day, you would do a to-do **list**. When you need to record phone numbers of your phone, you would have to associate a number with a name. These are all examples of `collections` in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can think of a `collection` as a container of multiple things. A collection can be ordered, such as a to-do list, or unordered such as a toy box. A collection may also consist of mappings, such as from mobile phones to name and address in the case of an address book.\n",

This led us to the term **mutability** - whether items inside a container are editable. We will look into the way Python presents the term."

In contrast, 32-bit architecture only supports up to $2^32$ addresses (bytes), means they only support roughly **4GB** of maximum memory. That explains why the move to larger than 4GB of RAM forces us to employ 64-bit operating systems to fully utilise the memory space.\n",

It does not make much sense to store an identical number in 2 distinct memory addresses, right? It is the same value after all, so we do not wish to create a new container for the value every time we call it.
